# Basic Three.js Example

This is a basic example of how to use Three.js to create a 3D scene in the browser.

## Usage

Open the index.html file in a web browser to see the 3D scene.

## Description

This example creates a new scene, adds a camera, creates a cube object and adds it to the scene, and adds lighting to the scene. The scene is then animated by rotating the cube and moving it in the z axis.

## Setup

This project uses a import map to load the Three.js library from a CDN. The import map is specified in the index.html file.
